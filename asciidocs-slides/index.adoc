== MicroProfile Example with Quarkus

* MicroProfile OpenAPI
* MicroProfile Fault Tolerance
* Monitoring
** MicroProfile Health
** MicroProfile Metrics
** MicroProfile OpenTracing
** Short Recap

include::fault-tolerance.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Monitoring

a must due to  size and complexity of a Cloud-Native.

This can be achieved by:

* Health Checks
* Metrics
* Open Tracing

include::healt-checks.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::metrics.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::open-tracing.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Monitorring Short Recap

* The readiness and liveness of your services through MicroProfile Health and the ability to integrate these with Kubernetes
infrastructure.
* The service runtime analysis through MicroProfile Metrics and
the ability to monitor and alert through tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.
* The ability to understand the flow of requests through a system
of microservices through OpenTracing and tracer tools such as
Apache Zipkin or Jaeger.
