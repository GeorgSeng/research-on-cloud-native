== MicroProfile Example with Quarkus

* MicroProfile OpenAPI
* MicroProfile Fault Tolerance
* Monitoring
** MicroProfile Health
** MicroProfile Metrics
** MicroProfile OpenTracing
** Short Recap

== Monitoring

a must due to  size and complexity of a Cloud-Native.

This can be achieved by:

* Health Checks
* Metrics
* Open Tracing

include::metrics.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::open-tracing.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Monitorring Short Recap

* The *readiness and liveness* of your services through MicroProfile Health and the ability to integrate these with Kubernetes
infrastructure.
* The service *runtime analysis* through MicroProfile Metrics and
the ability to monitor and alert through tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.
* The *ability to understand the flow* of requests through a system
of microservices through OpenTracing and tracer tools such as
Apache Zipkin or Jaeger.
