=== Monitoring

Is a must due to the size and complexity of a Cloud-Native.

This can be archived by:

* Health Checks
* Metrics
* Open Tracing

include::metrics.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::open-tracing.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


== Short Recap

* The readiness and liveness of your services through MicroProfile Health and the ability to integrate these with Kubernetes
infrastructure.
* The service runtime analysis through MicroProfile Metrics and
the ability to monitor and alert through tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.
* The ability to understand the flow of requests through a system
of microservices through OpenTracing and tracer tools such as
Apache Zipkin or Jaeger.
