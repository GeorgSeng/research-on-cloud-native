Motivation

Health checks are used to check the state of a computing node from another machine (i.e. kubernetes service controller)
with the primary target,  being cloud infrastructure environments where automated processes maintain the state of computing nodes.

In this scenario, health checks are used to determine if a computing node needs to be discarded (terminated, shutdown) and eventually replaced by another (healthy) instance.

Itâ€™s not intended (although could be used) as a monitoring solution for human operators.
